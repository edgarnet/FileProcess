# FileProcess
This program reads input from an input file and reads each character at a time while evaluating its ascii value and whether it is a line, vowel, digit, alpha character, lowercase character, uppercase character, space, alphanumeric, or punctuation. Files will also be checked for a successful opening and closing (CptS 121).
